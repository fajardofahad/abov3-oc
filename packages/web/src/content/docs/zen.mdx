ABOV3 zen is a list of tested and verified models provided by the ABOV3 team.

:::note
abov3 zen is currently in beta.
:::

Zen works like any other provider in abov3. You login to abov3 zen and get
your API key. It's **completely optional** and you don't need to use it to use
ABOV3.

---

## Background

There are a large number of models out there but only a few of
these models work well as coding agents. Additionally, most providers are
configured very differently; so you get very different performance and quality.

:::tip
We tested a select group of models and providers that work well with abov3.
:::

So if you are using a model through something like OpenRouter, you can never be
sure if you are getting the best version of the model you want.

To fix this, we did a couple of things:

1. We tested a select group of models and talked to their teams about how to
   best run them.
2. We then worked with a few providers to make sure these were being served
   correctly.
3. Finally, we benchmarked the combination of the model/provider and came up
   with a list that we feel good recommending.

abov3 zen is an AI gateway that gives you access to these models.

## How it works

abov3 zen works like any other provider in abov3.

1. You sign in to **<a href={console}>abov3 zen</a>** and get your API key.
2. You run `abov3 auth login` and select abov3 zen and add your API key.
3. Run `/models` in the TUI to see the list of models we recommend.

You are charged per request and you can add credits to your account.

## Goals

We created abov3 zen to:

1. **Benchmark** the best models/providers for coding agents.
2. Have access to the **highest quality** options and not downgrade performance or route to cheaper providers.
3. Pass along any **price drops** by selling at cost; so the only markup is to cover our processing fees.
4. Have **no lock-in** by allowing you to use it with any other coding agent. And always let you use any other provider with abov3 as well.

## Pricing

Below are the models that we currently support and their prices **per 1M
tokens**.

| Model | Input | Output |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Qwen3 Coder 480B | $0.38 | $0.50 |
| Grok Code Fast 1 | Free | Free |
| Sonnet 4 | Soon | Soon |

:::note
We add a small markup to cover our costs.
:::

A couple of notes:

- These are the raw prices based on the provider we are using internally. We
charge a small markup on top of this to cover our processing fees.
- Grok Code Fast 1 is currently free on abov3 till Sep 10th. The xAI team is
  using this time to collect feedback and improve Grok Code.
