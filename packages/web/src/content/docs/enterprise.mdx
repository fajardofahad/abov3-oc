import config from "../../../config.mjs"
export const email = `mailto:${config.email}`

abov3 does not store any of your code or context data. This makes it easy for
 you to use abov3 at your organization.

To get started, we recommend:

1. Do a trial internally with your team.
2. **<a href={email}>Contact us</a>** to discuss pricing and implementation options.

---

## Trial

Since abov3 is open source and does not store any of your code or context data, your developers can simply [get started](/docs/) and carry out a trial.

---

### Data handling

**abov3 does not store your code or context data.** All processing happens locally or through direct API calls to your AI provider.

The only caveat here is the optional `/share` feature.

---

#### Sharing conversations

If a user enables the `/share` feature, the conversation and the data associated with it are sent to the service we use to host these shares pages at abov3.ai.

The data is currently served through our CDN's edge network, and is cached on the edge near your users.

We recommend you disable this for your trial.

```json title="abov3.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://abov3.ai/config.json",
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

[Learn more about sharing](/docs/share).

---

### Code ownership

**You own all code produced by abov3.** There are no licensing restrictions or ownership claims.

---

## Deployment

Once you have completed your trial and you are ready to self-host abov3 at
your organization, you can **<a href={email}>contact us</a>** to discuss
pricing and implementation options.

---

### SSO

SSO integration can be implemented for enterprise deployments after your trial.
This will allow your team's session data and shared conversations to be protected
by your enterprise's authentication system.

---

### Private NPM

abov3 supports private npm registries through Bun's native `.npmrc` file support. If your organization uses a private registry, such as JFrog Artifactory, Nexus, or similar, ensure developers are authenticated before running abov3.

To set up authentication with your private registry:

```bash
npm login --registry=https://your-company.jfrog.io/api/npm/npm-virtual/
```

This creates `~/.npmrc` with authentication details. abov3 will automatically
pick this up.

:::caution
You must be logged into the private registry before running abov3.
:::

Alternatively, you can manually configure a `.npmrc` file:

```bash title="~/.npmrc"
registry=https://your-company.jfrog.io/api/npm/npm-virtual/
//your-company.jfrog.io/api/npm/npm-virtual/:_authToken=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

Developers must be logged into the private registry before running abov3 to ensure packages can be installed from your enterprise registry.

---

### Self-hosting

The share feature can be self-hosted and the share pages can be made accessible
only after the user has been authenticated.
